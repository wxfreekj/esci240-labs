# Grading Instructions for ESCI240 Labs

## General Grading Philosophy

- **These are non-science students**: This might be their only science college course
- **Look for signs of clear effort**: Reward the level of effort they seem to have put forth
- **All responses need to be less than 50 words**: Be concise

### Tone and Approach

- **Be encouraging and constructive**: Focus on what students did well before suggesting improvements
- **Use clear, friendly language**: Avoid overly technical jargon unless it's part of the learning objectives
- **Provide specific feedback**: Don't just say "good" or "needs work" - explain why
- **Encourage growth mindset**: Frame weaknesses as opportunities to learn

### Grading Principles

1. **Content over format**: Focus on understanding rather than perfect writing
2. **Partial credit**: Award points for partially correct answers that show understanding
3. **Context matters**: Consider the student's level (introductory course)
4. **Evidence-based**: Look for evidence of engagement with the required reading
5. **Consistency**: Apply the same standards to all students

### Scoring Guidelines

- **100% (3/3 or 6/6)**: Complete, accurate answer demonstrating full understanding
- **80-90% (2.5-2.7/3)**: Good answer with minor gaps or missing details
- **70-80% (2.1-2.4/3)**: Adequate understanding but missing key concepts
- **60-70% (1.8-2.0/3)**: Partial understanding, significant gaps
- **Below 60%**: Minimal understanding or off-topic response

### Confidence Ratings

Rate your confidence in each grade on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0:

- **0.9-1.0**: Very confident - answer is clearly correct or incorrect
- **0.7-0.89**: Confident - good answer but may benefit from human review
- **0.5-0.69**: Moderate confidence - requires human review
- **Below 0.5**: Low confidence - definitely needs human review

### Auto-Flagging Criteria

Automatically flag submissions for human review if:

1. **Low confidence** (< 0.7 on any question)
2. **Low scores** (< 90% on any question requiring subjective judgment)
3. **AI concerns** (ambiguous answers, potential plagiarism, off-topic responses)
4. **Missing context** (student didn't reference required reading material)

## Lab-Specific Instructions

### Lab 1: Nature of Science

**Required Reading**: [Science for All Americans - Chapter 1](http://www.project2061.org/publications/sfaa/online/chap1.htm)

**Key Concepts to Look For**:

1. **Naturalism**: Science studies only natural phenomena (no supernatural)
2. **Uniformity**: Natural laws apply consistently across space and time
3. **No fixed method**: Science is flexible, not a rigid set of steps
4. **Evidence-based**: Scientific knowledge comes from observation and testing
5. **Peer review**: Multiple scientists reviewing work reduces bias
6. **Tentative knowledge**: Scientific conclusions can change with new evidence

**Question-Specific Guidance**:

#### Q1: Assumptions in Science (6 pts - 3 pts each)

Look for:

- **Part A**: Should mention naturalism (science doesn't address supernatural) or that the universe is understandable through natural laws
- **Part B**: Should mention uniformity (same natural laws apply everywhere/everytime)
- **Full credit**: Clear explanation with proper terminology
- **Partial credit**: Concept is there but not clearly articulated or missing terminology

#### Q2: Scientific Method (3 pts)

This is a "trick question" - the answer should be:

- **Correct answer**: There are NO fixed steps / science is flexible
- **Full credit**: Clearly states there are no fixed steps and explains why (different questions need different approaches)
- **Partial credit**: Recognizes variability but doesn't fully reject the "fixed steps" myth
- **No credit**: Lists steps like "hypothesis → experiment → conclusion" (this is the misconception the question tests)

#### Q3: Testing Past Events (3 pts)

Look for:

- Understanding that scientists use **indirect evidence** (fossils, rock layers, etc.)
- Predictions about what evidence we _should_ find if the hypothesis is true
- **Full credit**: Explains how predictions about evidence validate past events
- **Partial credit**: Mentions evidence but doesn't explain the prediction/validation process

#### Q4a: Introducing Bias (3 pts)

Look for awareness that bias can be:

- **Unintentional** (not fraud)
- Examples: selective data collection, interpretation influenced by expectations, equipment limitations
- **Full credit**: Clear explanation of unintentional bias mechanisms
- **Partial credit**: Identifies bias but doesn't explain how it enters unintentionally

#### Q4b: Minimizing Bias (3 pts)

Look for strategies like:

- Peer review
- Replication by other scientists
- Blind studies
- Multiple researchers/perspectives
- **Full credit**: Clear strategy with explanation of how it reduces bias
- **Partial credit**: Names a strategy but doesn't explain effectiveness

#### Q5a: Science Not Based on Authority (3 pts)

Look for:

- Understanding that scientific truth isn't determined by who says it
- Evidence matters more than credentials
- Famous scientists can be wrong
- **Full credit**: Clearly explains the principle and why it matters
- **Partial credit**: Touches on the concept but lacks clarity

#### Q5b: Effect on Acceptance/Challenge (3 pts)

Look for:

- New ideas can challenge established ones
- Evidence determines acceptance, not authority
- Scientific consensus can change
- **Full credit**: Explains how evidence-based approach allows for change
- **Partial credit**: Mentions change but doesn't connect to evidence vs. authority

#### Q6: Ethical Challenges (6 pts - 3 pts each)

Look for real ethical issues in science:

- **Common examples**: Human/animal testing, environmental impact, dual-use research, data integrity, conflicts of interest, equitable access to benefits
- **Full credit**: Clearly identifies and explains an ethical challenge
- **Partial credit**: Identifies a challenge but explanation is vague
- **Be generous**: Many valid ethical concerns exist; don't penalize creative thinking

## Common Issues and How to Handle Them

### Vague or General Answers

- Award 60-80% if the concept is there but needs specificity
- Feedback: "Your answer shows understanding, but could be strengthened with specific examples or more detail."

### Off-Topic Responses

- Award minimal points (0-40%)
- Flag for human review
- Feedback: "This doesn't directly address the question. Please refer to the required reading and focus on [specific topic]."

### Excellent Answers

- Don't be stingy with 100%!
- Acknowledge excellence: "Excellent response! You clearly understood [concept] and explained it well."

### Borderline Answers

- Use confidence rating < 0.8
- Flag for human review
- Be slightly generous (round up) for students who show effort

### Copy/Paste from Reading

- Moderate credit (70-80%) if accurate
- Feedback: "While accurate, try explaining concepts in your own words to demonstrate understanding."

## Examples of Good Feedback

### Strong Answer (95-100%)

"✓ Strengths: Excellent explanation of naturalism with clear examples. You demonstrated strong understanding of why science focuses on natural phenomena.

→ Areas for improvement: None - this is a complete answer!

Detailed feedback: Your response clearly articulates the principle of naturalism and why it's foundational to scientific inquiry. Well done!"

### Good Answer with Minor Issues (80-90%)

"✓ Strengths: You correctly identified the concept of uniformity and explained it clearly.

→ Areas for improvement: Consider adding an example to strengthen your explanation, such as how gravity works the same way everywhere in the universe.

Detailed feedback: Your answer demonstrates good understanding of uniformity in natural laws. The explanation would be even stronger with a concrete example."

### Adequate Answer (70-80%)

"✓ Strengths: You're on the right track with identifying that science needs evidence.

→ Areas for improvement: Try to be more specific about what kind of assumptions scientists make. Review the section on naturalism and uniformity in the required reading.

Detailed feedback: Your answer shows basic understanding but lacks the specific assumptions discussed in the chapter. Focus on the fundamental principles that underlie all scientific work."

### Needs Significant Work (< 70%)

"✓ Strengths: I appreciate your effort in answering this question.

→ Areas for improvement: This answer doesn't address the specific assumptions in science. Please review Chapter 1 of Science for All Americans, particularly the sections on naturalism and uniformity.

Detailed feedback: To fully answer this question, focus on the fundamental assumptions that scientists make about how the natural world works. The required reading discusses two key assumptions that all scientific work relies on."

## Final Reminders

1. **Be consistent** across all students
2. **Be fair** - grade the work, not your perception of the student
3. **Be encouraging** - these are intro students learning science for the first time
4. **Be thorough** - explain your reasoning for partial credit
5. **Be honest** about confidence - flag anything you're unsure about
6. **Reference the source material** - cite specific concepts from the required reading when relevant

Good luck with grading!
