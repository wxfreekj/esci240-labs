## Questions and Rubric

### Question 1: Assumptions in Science (6 points total)

**Part A** (3 points): _Describe an assumption in science._

**Expected concepts**:

- Naturalism: Science studies only natural phenomena
- The universe operates by natural laws that can be discovered
- Supernatural explanations are outside the scope of science
- Nature is understandable through observation and reason

**Grading criteria**:

- 3 pts: Clear description of assumption
- 2.5 pts: Concept present but terminology missing or explanation unclear
- 2-1.5 pts: Vague reference to science studying nature
- 0-0.5 pts: Off-topic or missing

---

**Part B** (3 points): _Describe a second assumption in science._

**Expected concepts**:

- Same laws work everywhere in the universe
- Same laws work at all times (past, present, future)
- Patterns observed today applied in the past

**Grading criteria**:

- 3 pts: Clear description of assumption
- 2.5 pts: Concept present but terminology missing or explanation unclear
- 2-1.5 pts: Vague reference to science studying nature
- 0-0.5 pts: Off-topic or missing

---

### Question 2: Scientific Method (3 points)

**Question**: _What are the fixed steps of science that scientists always follow?_

**IMPORTANT**: This is a "trick question" testing whether students understand there are NO fixed steps.

**Expected answer**:

- There are NO fixed steps in science
- Science is flexible and adaptable
- Different questions require different approaches
- The "scientific method" as taught in elementary school is a simplification

**Grading criteria**:

- 3 pts: Clearly states there are no fixed steps and explains why (flexible, context-dependent)
- 2-2.5 pts: Recognizes variability but doesn't fully reject the "fixed steps" idea
- 1-1.5 pts: Shows some understanding that science is flexible but unclear
- 1 pts: Lists traditional steps (hypothesis → experiment → conclusion) - this is the misconception

---

### Question 3: Testing Past Events (3 points)

**Question**: _Since scientific ideas are often validated by making predictions about future events, how can scientists test or validate ideas about events that happened in the past?_

**Expected concepts**:

- Indirect evidence (fossils, rock layers, ice cores, etc.)
- Making predictions about what evidence SHOULD exist if hypothesis is true
- Testing predictions by searching for that evidence
- Example: If dinosaurs existed, we should find their fossils

**Grading criteria**:

- 3 pts: Explains prediction-based validation with clear example
- 2-2.5 pts: Mentions evidence but doesn't fully explain the prediction process
- 1-1.5 pts: Vague reference to fossils or evidence
- 0-0.5 pts: Off-topic or missing

---

### Question 4: Minimizing Bias (6 points total)

**Part A** (3 points): _How might a scientist introduce bias into their data unintentionally?_

**Expected concepts**:

- UNINTENTIONAL bias (not fraud or dishonesty)
- Selective attention to data that confirms expectations
- Interpretation influenced by personal beliefs
- Equipment limitations or measurement choices
- Cultural or educational background affecting perspective

**Grading criteria**:

- 3 pts: Clear explanation of unintentional bias mechanisms with examples
- 2-2.5 pts: Identifies bias sources but lacks detail on how it's unintentional
- 1-1.5 pts: Mentions bias but doesn't explain mechanisms
- 0-0.5 pts: Describes intentional fraud (not what the question asks)

---

**Part B** (3 points): _What is one strategy scientists can use to minimize bias in their work?_

**Expected strategies**:

- Peer review by other scientists
- Replication of experiments by independent researchers
- Blind or double-blind studies
- Multiple investigators with different backgrounds
- Standardized protocols and measurements
- Open data sharing

**Grading criteria**:

- 3 pts: Clear strategy with explanation of how it reduces bias
- 2-2.5 pts: Names valid strategy but explanation is incomplete
- 1-1.5 pts: Vague reference to checking work
- 0-0.5 pts: Invalid or off-topic strategy

---

### Question 5: Science and Authority (6 points total)

**Part A** (3 points): _What does it mean to say that science is not based on authority?_

**Expected concepts**:

- Scientific truth isn't determined by who says it
- Evidence matters more than credentials or fame
- Even famous scientists can be wrong
- No scientist has "special access" to truth
- Ideas are judged on merit, not on the source

**Grading criteria**:

- 3 pts: Clear explanation of evidence over authority principle
- 2-2.5 pts: Touches on concept but lacks complete explanation
- 1-1.5 pts: Vague reference to scientists being questioned
- 0-0.5 pts: Off-topic or missing

---

**Part B** (3 points): _How does this affect the way scientific knowledge is accepted or challenged?_

**Expected concepts**:

- New ideas can challenge established theories
- Evidence determines acceptance, not the proposer's status
- Scientific consensus can change with new evidence
- Young/unknown scientists can make important discoveries
- Healthy skepticism is encouraged

**Grading criteria**:

- 3 pts: Explains how evidence-based approach enables change and challenges
- 2-2.5 pts: Mentions change but doesn't fully connect to evidence vs. authority
- 1-1.5 pts: Vague statement about science changing
- 0-0.5 pts: Off-topic or missing

---

### Question 6: Ethical Challenges (6 points total)

**Part A** (3 points): _Identify and explain one ethical challenge scientists face in their work._

**Common valid examples**:

- Human subject research (informed consent, risk/benefit)
- Animal testing (minimizing suffering, necessity)
- Environmental impact of research
- Data integrity and honesty
- Conflicts of interest (funding, patents)
- Dual-use research (potentially harmful applications)
- Equitable access to benefits
- Privacy and confidentiality

**Grading criteria**:

- 3 pts: Clearly identifies and explains a valid ethical challenge
- 2-2.5 pts: Identifies challenge but explanation needs more detail
- 1-1.5 pts: Vague reference to ethics
- 0-0.5 pts: Off-topic or not actually an ethical issue

---

**Part B** (3 points): _Identify and explain a SECOND ethical challenge scientists face in their work._

**Same criteria as Part A, but looking for a DIFFERENT challenge**

**Note**: Be generous - many valid ethical concerns exist. Don't penalize students for creative or unconventional answers if they're legitimate ethical issues.

## Key Concepts from Required Reading

From "Science for All Americans - Chapter 1":

### The Nature of Science

1. **Science is a way of knowing** - It's a process, not just a collection of facts
2. **Science is based on evidence** - Observations and experiments, not authority or belief
3. **Science is tentative** - Scientific knowledge can change with new evidence
4. **Science has limitations** - It can't answer all questions (especially supernatural or ethical questions)

### Scientific Inquiry

- **No single scientific method** - Approaches vary by discipline and question
- **Creativity is essential** - Science requires imagination and innovation
- **Science is collaborative** - Multiple perspectives reduce bias
- **Peer review is crucial** - Other scientists check and verify work

### Scientific Worldview

- **The universe is understandable** - Natural phenomena follow patterns
- **Science is limited to natural phenomena** - Can't test supernatural claims
- **Scientific ideas are durable but tentative** - Theories can be refined or replaced
- **Science cannot provide complete answers to all questions** - Especially ethical, aesthetic, or spiritual questions

### Scientific Enterprise

- **Science is a social activity** - Scientists work in communities
- **Science is organized into disciplines** - But connections exist between fields
- **Science benefits from diversity** - Different backgrounds bring different insights
- **Ethical considerations guide research** - Scientists must consider impacts

## Common Student Misconceptions to Address

1. **"The scientific method has fixed steps"** - Actually, science is flexible
2. **"Science proves things"** - Science builds evidence; it doesn't "prove" in absolute terms
3. **"Scientists are always objective"** - Bias exists; safeguards minimize it
4. **"Famous scientists are always right"** - Authority doesn't determine truth
5. **"Science can answer all questions"** - Science is limited to testable natural phenomena
6. **"Past events can't be studied scientifically"** - Indirect evidence allows testing
