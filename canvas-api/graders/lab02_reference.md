## URL Validation Rules (for Autograder)

### Domain Checking

```python
def check_domain(url, required_domain):
    """
    Validates that URL contains required domain
    Handles both http:// and https://
    Handles www. and non-www versions
    """
    from urllib.parse import urlparse
    parsed = urlparse(url.lower().strip())
    domain = parsed.netloc.replace('www.', '')
    return required_domain in domain
```

### Path Checking

```python
def check_path_contains(url, required_terms):
    """
    Validates that URL path contains required terms
    Case-insensitive matching
    """
    from urllib.parse import urlparse
    parsed = urlparse(url.lower())
    path = parsed.path.lower()
    return any(term in path for term in required_terms)
```

### Caption Validation

- Minimum length: 10 characters
- Should not be just "N/A" or "None"
- Should contain at least 2-3 words
- Bonus points for mentioning specific features

## Common Student Errors to Watch For

### URL Issues

1. **Homepage instead of specific page** - Deduct 1-1.5 points
2. **Wrong domain entirely** - 0 points for that question
3. **HTTP 404 or dead links** - Flag for human review
4. **PDF links instead of interactive pages** - Acceptable if relevant
5. **Missing https:// prefix** - Still valid, don't penalize

### Caption Issues

1. **Too brief** ("weather map") - Deduct 0.5 points
2. **Copy-pasted site description** - Acceptable but note lack of originality
3. **Doesn't match URL content** - Deduct 1 point
4. **Missing entirely** - Deduct 0.5-1 point

### Format Issues

1. **Multiple URLs in one answer** - Grade the first valid one
2. **URL in caption field** - Try to parse appropriately
3. **Caption in URL field** - 0 points, needs human review

## Test Data for Validation

### Test Student Submission (ID: 88888)

```
1. https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/
   Caption: Comprehensive weather analysis with models, satellite, and observations

2. https://www.weather.gov/okx/
   Caption: NWS New York office with human forecaster discussions

3. https://www.pivotalweather.com/model.php?m=gfs
   Caption: GFS model forecasts with multiple parameters

4. https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/30day/
   Caption: 30-day temperature and precipitation outlooks

5. https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/
   Caption: Current U.S. drought conditions map

6. https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/
   Caption: Hurricane climatology and historical data

7. https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/
   Caption: Severe weather climatology by location

8. https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/hazard/
   Caption: Hazardous weather research and climatology

9. https://www.spc.noaa.gov/new/SVRclimo/climo.php?parm=anySvr

10. The NWS site provides official government forecasts with detailed discussions
    from meteorologists, making it highly reliable but sometimes technical.
    TropicalTidbits offers excellent visualization tools and is more user-friendly
    for students, but lacks the official forecast discussions.
```

**Expected Score**: 30/30 (perfect score for test validation)

## Grading Workflow

### Automated Checking Process

1. Parse student submission text file
2. Extract URLs and captions for Q1-Q9
3. Validate each URL against domain/path requirements
4. Check caption presence and quality
5. Grade Q10 for comparison elements
6. Calculate total score
7. Generate feedback for each question
8. Flag any responses with confidence < 0.8

### Human Review Triggers

- Any score below 24/30 (80%)
- Dead links (HTTP errors)
- Ambiguous URLs that might be valid
- Q10 responses that seem off-topic
- Missing multiple captions
- Suspicious patterns (all same domain, etc.)

---

## Feedback Templates

### Perfect Response (3/3)

"✓ Excellent! Your URL correctly links to [specific resource] and your caption clearly describes [what it shows]."

### Good Response (2.5/3)

"✓ Good URL choice for [resource type]. Minor issue: [specific improvement needed]."

### Needs Improvement (1-2/3)

"↑ Your URL links to [what they provided] but the assignment asks for [what was expected]. Please review the requirement for [specific instruction]."

### Missing/Invalid (0/3)

"✗ This URL doesn't meet the requirement for [specific resource]. Please find a link that [specific guidance]."

### Q10 Feedback Examples

**Excellent (3/3)**:
"✓ Excellent comparison! You clearly identified specific strengths and weaknesses of both sites and showed good understanding of their different purposes."

**Good (2.5/3)**:
"✓ Good comparison overall. To improve, be more specific about [particular aspect]."

**Adequate (2/3)**:
"✓ You've identified the sites but could strengthen your comparison by discussing specific features that make each unique."

## Implementation Notes for Autograder

### URL Fetch Testing

- Use HEAD requests first to check if URL is alive
- Cache results to avoid repeated fetches
- Timeout after 5 seconds
- Handle redirects (follow up to 3)

### Confidence Scoring

- 1.0 = Perfect domain + path match
- 0.9 = Correct domain, acceptable path variation
- 0.8 = Correct site type but different domain
- 0.7 = Related but not ideal
- <0.7 = Flag for human review

### Special Cases

- Accept both http and https
- Handle trailing slashes flexibly
- Accept www and non-www versions
- International domains (.gov, .edu, .org, .com all valid)
- Mobile URLs (m.site.com) are acceptable
